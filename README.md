# Search for {selected text} in Incognito mode

![in action](in_action.png)

Recently one of my friends reached out to me to create an extension
where he could use the selected text to be searched in Google chrome's
incognito mode.  

I've created a small extension where you could do exactly that.  

Just download the zip file from Github and use Load unpacked extension
feature.

Find the extension in Google Chrome store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-in-incognito/hiiafoidfbddfcnolnmklcdfoijddelf
